## **An Observatory for the IPFS Network ðŸ”­**

We're excited to share that the ProbeLab team has worked hard over the past year to build a resilient and fully-automated infrastructure to monitor the performance of core IPFS stack protocols. The debut of this new measurement platform is big news, and you can learn all about it in a new post on the IPFS blog.

[A Rusty Bootstrapper](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-rust-libp2p-based-ipfs-bootstrap-node/)

- As of July 13, 2023, one of the four "public good" IPFS bootstrap nodes operated by Protocol Labs has been runningÂ rust-libp2p-server instead ofÂ Kubo, which usesÂ go-libp2p. rust-libp2p-server is a thin wrapper aroundÂ rust-libp2p. We run both Kubo and rust-libp2p-server on IPFS bootstrap nodes to increase resilience. [Read more about it on the IPFS blog!](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-rust-libp2p-based-ipfs-bootstrap-node/)
